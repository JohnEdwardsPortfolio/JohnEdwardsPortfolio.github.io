                    <p>Hi, I'm John Edwards, a passionate developer with expertise in web development, AI, and mobile app creation. With years of experience and a love for cutting-edge technologies, I strive to create innovative solutions that make a difference.</p>
                    <p>My journey in tech began as an unexpected plot twist in my career story. After years as a dedicated English teacher, I found myself battling burnout and yearning for a new challenge. Intrigued by the rapidly evolving world of technology, I decided to take a leap of faith and explore this digital frontier. I started by teaching myself basic coding during my evenings and weekends, and soon discovered a passion for creating and problem-solving that rivaled my love for literature. This newfound enthusiasm led me to enroll in an intensive coding bootcamp, where I immersed myself in web development, AI, and mobile app creation. The transition wasn't easy, but my background in education proved invaluable â€“ my ability to break down complex concepts, attention to detail, and passion for continuous learning perfectly complemented my new technical skills. Since then, I've worked on numerous projects, constantly expanding my abilities and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends. My unique journey from classroom to code has given me a distinctive perspective, allowing me to bridge the gap between technology and user experience in ways that continue to surprise and delight my clients.</p>
